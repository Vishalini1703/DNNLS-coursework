Epochs trained: 2

Baseline model:
Final validation loss (epoch 2): 1.3475
Final validation perplexity: 3.85

Memory model:
Final validation loss (epoch 2): 1.3404
Final validation perplexity: 3.82


The memory model did not outperform the baseline within the limited training budget. 
Training curves for both models were very similar.
